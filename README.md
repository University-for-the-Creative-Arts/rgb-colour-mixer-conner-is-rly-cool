# Colour Switcher

Gonna be honest did this somewhere else 

https://github.com/GingerNinjaProgramming/FunFunRepoOfColour - Actual proj

You can use four sliders to change the RGBA values of a circle in the middle of the screen

These can then be saved on a json file that is saved and loaded from when the project is opened and closed
